[Module/feature name] Commit Message Title
# This line contains two parts:
# 1. [Module/feature name]: The main area of the codebase affected by this change.
#    - Keep it short and specific.
#    - Examples: auth, api_handler, db_migration, cache, user_profile, etc.
#    - AI Hint: Analyze the diff to determine which module or feature is primarily impacted.
#
# 2. Commit Message Title: A concise summary of what the change does, starting with an imperative verb.
#    - Keep it under 50 characters if possible.
#    - Focus on *what* was done, not *why* (details go in the Description section).
#    - Examples: Fix token refresh bug, Add user avatar upload, Refactor auth middleware.
#    - AI Hint: Generate a clear, action-oriented title that summarizes the key change.

[Description]
# Describe the changes made in more detail.
# AI Hint: Summarize the key changes based on the diff. Use clear and concise language.
# - What functionality was added, modified, or fixed?
# - Highlight any changes that might impact other modules.
# - Mention if any dependencies, APIs, or configs were updated.
# - Use bullet points or a short paragraph for readability.
# Example:
# - Refactored login flow for faster response time.
# - Added caching to API responses to reduce DB load.
# - Fixed race condition in user session handling.

[Motivation]
# Explain why this change is necessary.
# AI Hint: Identify the purpose of the change.
# - Is this a bug fix, performance improvement, or new feature?
# - If related to a ticket/issue, mention the reference.
# - Describe the problem that this change addresses.
# Example:
# - Resolves issue #123 where users could not log in after session timeout.
# - Improves query performance by adding indexes.

[Self-Test]
# Describe the tests performed before committing
# AI Hint:
# Review the code changes in this commit and infer the relevant self-tests that should be performed before submission.
# Provide a clear checklist of recommended tests based on the commit content.
# Consider the following when generating the list:
# - What parts of the system are affected (logic, UI, configuration, documentation)?
# - Which testing methods are most relevant (unit, integration, manual, CI build)?
# - Are there dependencies, side effects, or external APIs to verify?
# If no testing is required (e.g., documentation or comments only), state that explicitly.
#
# Output format example:
# - Build and compile successfully.
# - Run updated unit tests and confirm they pass.
# - Manually verify new API response in Postman.
# - Check UI rendering in Chrome and Firefox.
# - No testing required (documentation-only change).

# ## AI Review Session ##
# AI Hint: This section is for internal use only and must NOT be included in the actual commit.
# - All lines in this section MUST begin with '#' so Git treats them as comments.
# - Review the code changes based on the diff.
# - Think critically about correctness, readability, performance, safety, and design.
# - You may raise multiple issues, suggestions, or notes if applicable.
# - If identifying a potential risk or improvement, mention the **filename** so it's easy to locate.
# - Suggest improvements, flag risks, or highlight edge cases the author may have missed.
# Example output:
# AI Suggestion ('auth_handler.py'): 'parseUserInput()' could return early to simplify logic.
# AI Note ('user_profile.py'): Consider checking for null in 'user.getProfile()' to avoid a crash.
# AI Tip ('db_migration.sql'): Avoid using 'SELECT *' for better migration stability.

#AI- # here is the example of it.

#AI- [auth] Fix session timeout not clearing stale tokens
#AI- 
#AI- [Description]
#AI- - Fixed a bug where user sessions were not properly invalidated after timeout.
#AI- - Updated the token cleanup logic in 'auth/session_manager.py'.
#AI- - Adjusted Redis TTL to ensure tokens expire consistently.
#AI- - Minor logging improvements for session errors.
#AI- 
#AI- [Motivation]
#AI- - Fixes #231: Users remained logged in on stale sessions, causing 403 errors.
#AI- - Ensures that security policies on session expiry are enforced.
#AI- - Related to security audit findings for Q2.
#AI- 
#AI- [Self-Test]
#AI- - Run unit tests for 'auth/session_manager_test.py'.
#AI- - Manually verify session timeout and token cleanup in staging.
#AI- - Confirm Redis TTL values match configuration constants.
#AI- - Check logs for expected "Session expired" entries.
#AI- - Ensure build and CI pipeline pass.
#AI- - Review dependent modules for TTL-related side effects.
#AI- 
#AI- ## AI Review Session ##
#AI- Summary: This commit addresses session cleanup bugs and enhances token refresh logic.
#AI- Suggestion ('token_service.py'): Consider extracting token TTL logic into a config constant for better maintainability and easier updates.
#AI- Potential Risk ('redis_store.py'): Changing the Redis TTL might unintentionally affect other features sharing the same key pattern.
#AI- Review Tip ('session_manager.py'): Review whether other logic still depends on the old TTL behavior — especially cleanup timers and background jobs.
