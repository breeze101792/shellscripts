[Module/feature name] Commit Message Title

[Description]
# Describe the changes made in more detail.
# AI Hint: Summarize the key changes based on the diff. Use clear and concise language.
# - What functionality was added, modified, or fixed?
# - Highlight any changes that might impact other modules.
# - Mention if any dependencies, APIs, or configs were updated.
# - Use bullet points or a short paragraph for readability.
# Example:
# - Refactored login flow for faster response time.
# - Added caching to API responses to reduce DB load.
# - Fixed race condition in user session handling.

[Motivation]
# Explain why this change is necessary.
# AI Hint: Identify the purpose of the change.
# - Is this a bug fix, performance improvement, or new feature?
# - If related to a ticket/issue, mention the reference.
# - Describe the problem that this change addresses.
# Example:
# - Resolves issue #123 where users could not log in after session timeout.
# - Improves query performance by adding indexes.

[Self-Test]
# Describe the tests performed before committing.
# AI Hint: List any tests or checks used to validate the changes.
# - Unit tests? Integration tests? Manual verification?
# - Mention if the build or CI passed successfully.
# - If no tests were performed, write "No tests performed."
# Example:
# - Build succeeded.
# - Unit tests passed with coverage > 90%.
# - Manually verified API response using Postman.
# - No tests performed (documentation only).

# [AI Review Session]
# AI Hint: This section is for internal use only.
# - All lines in this section MUST begin with `#` so Git treats them as comments.
# - Review the code changes based on the diff.
# - Think critically about correctness, readability, performance, safety, and design.
# - You may raise multiple issues, suggestions, or notes if applicable.
# - Suggest improvements, flag risks, or highlight edge cases the author may have missed.
# Example output:
# AI Suggestion: `parseUserInput()` could return early to simplify logic.
# AI Note: Consider checking for null in `user.getProfile()` to avoid a crash.
# AI Tip: Use `with open()` to ensure the file is properly closed.

#AI- [auth] Fix session timeout not clearing stale tokens
#AI- 
#AI- [Description]
#AI- - Fixed a bug where user sessions were not properly invalidated after timeout.
#AI- - Updated the token cleanup logic in `auth/session_manager.py`.
#AI- - Adjusted Redis TTL to ensure tokens expire consistently.
#AI- - Minor logging improvements for session errors.
#AI- 
#AI- [Motivation]
#AI- - Fixes #231: Users remained logged in on stale sessions, causing 403 errors.
#AI- - Ensures that security policies on session expiry are enforced.
#AI- - Related to security audit findings for Q2.
#AI- 
#AI- [Self-Test]
#AI- - All unit tests passed (pytest).
#AI- - Manually verified token expiry behavior in staging.
#AI- - Build and CI pipeline passed on GitHub Actions.
#AI- 
#AI- # [AI Review Session]
#AI- # AI Summary: The commit addresses session cleanup bugs and improves token management.
#AI- # Suggestion: Consider extracting token TTL logic into a config constant to improve maintainability.
#AI- # Potential Risk: Ensure the Redis TTL change doesn't impact other modules using shared keys.
#AI- # Review Tip: Check if `session_manager.py` has other logic relying on the old TTL behavior.
